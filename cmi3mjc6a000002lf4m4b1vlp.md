Google Summer of Code (GSoC) has always been a dream pathway for me — contributing to real-world open-source software, collaborating with global developers, and building something meaningful. Today, I am officially taking my **first step** toward achieving **GSoC 2026**, and I’m sharing my journey openly.

This blog marks the beginning — not the destination.

## 🌱 Why GSoC Matters to Me

GSoC is more than a program. It’s an opportunity to:

* Work on real software used by thousands
    
* Learn from expert open-source mentors
    
* Improve my development skills massively
    
* Build strong credibility as a developer
    
* Contribute to something bigger than myself
    

I’m not preparing casually.  
I’m preparing early and intentionally.

## 🛠️ Where I Am Starting Today

Right now, my focus is on building a strong technical foundation.

I’m currently learning and improving:

* MERN Stack
    
* Java + DSA
    
* Git & GitHub Workflow
    
* API development
    
* Frontend UI/UX fundamentals
    

I’m not a master yet — but I’m consistent, and that is my biggest strength.

## 🎧 The Projects I’m Building Right Now

To sharpen my skills before jumping into open-source contributions, I am working on:

### 🎨 1. Spotify Clone UI (HTML + CSS)

A clean, responsive UI project to strengthen frontend design skills.

### 📘 2. Gate Quest — My Mini Project

A test-practice platform where students can:

* Attempt subject-wise quizzes
    
* Track scores
    
* View solutions
    
* Prepare efficiently
    

This helps me practice real-world web app development.

### ☕ 3. Java + DSA Repository

Daily structured problem-solving with clean, readable code.

These projects are building the confidence and technical depth I will need for GSoC contributions.

## 🚀 How I Will Start Contributing to Open Source

I’m not rushing into difficult codebases. My plan is structured and beginner-friendly.

### Step 1: Master Git and GitHub

Branches, forks, pull requests, issues — the real fundamentals.

### Step 2: Choose beginner-friendly tasks

* Documentation updates
    
* Small UI fixes
    
* Minor bugs
    
* Basic enhancements
    

### Step 3: Contribute to beginner-friendly orgs

The organizations I’m planning to explore:

* OpenMRS
    
* Mozilla
    
* Oppia
    
* [Rocket.Chat](http://Rocket.Chat)
    
* LibreOffice
    

### Step 4: Write blogs for every milestone

Documenting each step helps:  
✔ me learn better  
✔ mentors see my consistency  
✔ others begin their journey too

## 🧭 My Roadmap to GSoC 2026

### 📅 Nov–Dec 2025

* Build projects
    
* Improve Git & GitHub workflow
    
* Increase coding consistency
    
* Publish blogs regularly
    

### 📅 Jan–Feb 2026

* Make beginner-friendly contributions
    
* Join community discussions

This structured approach keeps me focused and realistic.

## 🌟 Why I Am Sharing This

I’m documenting this journey openly because:

* It keeps me accountable
    
* It inspires other beginners
    
* It tracks my growth
    
* It builds my developer identity
    

This is **Day 1** of my GSoC 2026 journey — raw, honest, and filled with excitement.

## 🏁 What’s Coming Next

I’ll continue to share:

* My first open-source contributions
    
* GitHub progress
